# ManagersAroundTheWrold
Yaniv's Arad Final Project

This Project is all about create a large phonebook of all the managers around the world.

Each User\Coach has:
1. Sport Type
2. Name
3. Age
4. Current Club
5. Position
6. Open Text - some info about his work history
7. Status (is he open for a job)
8. Photo
9. Email
10. Show email to other users?
11. Phone
12. Show phone to other users?

Each Coach after signup will be able to:
- Search on other staff members
- Update his User
- Delete his User
- Add a post that is looking for a job

I will use mongoDB as a DB.
Auth in JWT + social logins

Will save the email on json file
